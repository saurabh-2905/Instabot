# Instabot

This project was done to get some handson experience with web automation. It was a fun way to learn about the selenium module. 

The user needs to enter the login credentials i.e. the login_id and password for the instagram account. It would be given to the program via a seperate file 'secret.py'. Once the credentials are given, the program will automatically log in to the acount and access the list of people you have followed and the ones who are following you. At the end the program will output the names of accounts that you are following but not getting followed back.
